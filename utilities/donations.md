# ðŸ’Œ Donation

**We created DWOS to try our best to give the people in need as much as we can. For that, we have assigned a % of every profit comes from the DWOS ecosystem to be donated. However, this page will be mainly dedicated to the Initial Donation.**

## General Information:

* Holders will vote for what organizations DWOS will donate to
* The following list is only for the Initial Donation, later donations destination will be decided by holders every month

## Donation Distribution:

Donation is a crucial task that we take so seriously. As the community grows, more plans and projects will be implemented to DWOS ecosystem, and we believe all implementations will bring profits for DAO and holders, and will give us the ability to donate to people in need and foundations that have a similar passion as we do. However, here is a donation distribution for all possible profits coming to the DWOS ecosystem:
