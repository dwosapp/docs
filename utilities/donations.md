# ðŸ’Œ Donations

#### We hope by doing this small action, we encourage more people to donate. No matter where the donation goes, nor whom to benefit, we believe people will make the right decision to choose to whom to donate to, the essence here is to donate more often.

#### Getting back to the docs, meanwhile as we have the control over DWOS project, we will choose to whom to initially donate. But whatever donation next will be a community driven donation with an approval of most holders, or as how the DAO voting mechanism are at that time.



### Initial donation details

In here you will find our initial donation details before and after the donation is done. Details such as to whom we are donating, how much the donation will be, and a proof that the donation has been done successfully.
