# ðŸŽŸ Raffles

#### And you though minting giveaways are too much! We also offer you "DWOS holders" the opportunity to always win big with our raffle system. Our tokens $tDWOS and $gDWOS will be considered as Raffle entries or tickets, where mostly each 1 $token equals 1 entry/ticket for the selected raffle. Raffle prizes varies between $, â—Ž, $tokens, irl prizes, merchs, whitelist spots in other projects, nfts, and blue chip nfts.

An nft categories list will be released soon, showing exact entry/ticket cost, requirements, and any other specific information.
{% endhint %}



### How DWOS Raffle works:

* All $tDWOS and $gDWOS received as a raffle entry/ticket will be sent back to DWOS dex wallet.
* Not only DWOS team can create raffles, partner projects can also apply to create a raffle with an agreement that should be announced before raffle starts.
* Some special raffles will have a harder requirements or higher entry/ticket price. Those special raffles are unique, and it may include large â—Ž or $ prizes, and blue chip nfts, and may take less place in our raffle system, and may also take longer gaps between every special raffle and the other.
* Most raffles will require you to be a DWOS holder.
