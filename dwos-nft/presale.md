#### Why should I consider buying a DWOS in Presale?

* Beside all the benefits you will get, what always makes me eager is buying at half the price
* You can now start helping us making new decisions in the project by your DWOS voting power
* x2 voting power for presale purchased NFTs, until we launch our on-chain DAO
* You can immediately start staking your DWOS and get ahead of others with more $tDWOS rewards
* The only possible way to swap between $t and $g in a fixed rate of: **1 $g = 4 $t**, which is approximately equals to 6 $t for other holders
* Presale staking rewards are x2, so each NFT will get you 2 $tDWOS per day until our minting day
* @Early adopter are the only community members that are eligible to vote on the Special Raffle Pools prizes
* The only way to obtain @Early adopter role. As our community grow, the advantages of @Early adopters will increase
* Automatically whitelisted in any future project
* The ability to get in any initial trials and/or tests
* Access to DWOS Lounge
* Being an @Early adopter will get you whitelisted automatically
* Please note that you'll get your presale purchased NFTs airdropped to you 1 to 7 days before public minting, and that you will get a randomly chosen NFT
