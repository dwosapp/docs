#### And now comes the hardest phase of them all, next you'll find the totally hard requirements to get a whitelist spot during this unbelievably hard phase.

### Option 1

* To honor the DWoS, we will only accept level 25 or higher.
* 5 real invites or more.

### Option 2

* This phase is so hard, that you only have one option to enroll :drum: Good Luck all.
