# üèÅ Whitelisting

{% hint style="danger" %}
Getting whitelisted doesn't secure you a minting spot, as we have 4000 spots for 3987 nfts. Though, we believe not all whitelisted people will mint.
{% endhint %}



### Whitelist spots: 4000

#### We know having this much of a WL spots makes it harder for non-whitelisted people to mint, but this will increase diversity in holders, as well as the effect of a single NFT per wallet max minting. We believe that this strategy will work the best with our roadmap.



### Whitelisting mechanism

We have divided the whitelist spots distribution into three phases, not including spots distributed to partner's holders and spots earned by attending or participating in a hosted event. A specific page of each phase can be found below, which you get more information about.

{% endcontent-ref %}



### Earned spots

During the "wen minting ser?" waiting time, we will be hosting all types of online social events include, but not limited to, raids, giveaways, and contests. You can attend or participate to these hosted events to get a whitelist spot.

### Partners

As we go further with this project we will secure more partnerships and collaborations. We might be offering them a certain number of whitelist spots, according to the deal made, which their holders will be able to get these spots for our upcoming mint. Visit the Partners page to get to know more.
