# üèÅ Whitelisting

{% hint style="danger" %}
Getting whitelisted doesn't secure you a minting spot, as we have 4000 spots for 3987 nfts. Though, we believe not all whitelisted people will mint.
{% endhint %}



### Whitelist spots: 4000

#### We know having this much of a WL spots makes it harder for non-whitelisted people to mint, but this will increase diversity in holders, as well as the effect of a single NFT per wallet max minting. We believe that this strategy will work the best with our roadmap.



### Whitelisting mechanism

We have divided the whitelist spots distribution into multiple categories, not including spots distributed to partner's holders and spots earned by attending or participating in a hosted event.

### Earned spots

During the "wen minting ser?" waiting time, we will be hosting all types of online social events include, but not limited to, raids, giveaways, and contests. You can attend or participate to these hosted events to get a whitelist spot. Also, you can visit our server store and buy yourself a role.
