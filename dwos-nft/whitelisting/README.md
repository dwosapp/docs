# 🏁 Whitelisting

### Whitelist spots: 1000

### Whitelisting mechanism

We have divided the whitelist spots distribution into multiple categories, not including spots distributed to partner's holders and spots earned by attending or participating in a hosted event.

{% endcontent-ref %}



### Earned spots

During the "wen minting ser?" waiting time, we will be hosting all types of online social events include, but not limited to, raids, giveaways, and contests. You can attend or participate to these hosted events to get a whitelist spot. Also, you can visit our server store and buy yourself a role.
