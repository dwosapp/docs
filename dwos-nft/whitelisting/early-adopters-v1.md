# 1âƒ£ Early adopters v1

### v1 spots: 500 / 4000

### v1 end date: Please refer to our discord server.



#### This might be the **easiest** way to get whitelisted through us, as we have planned the difficulty of all three phases. So without further ado, here are the requirements needed to be eligible for a spot during this phase.

### Option 1

* An early active member, reaching level 7 or more.
* Invited 1 real person or more.

### Option 2

* An early active member, reaching level 15 or more.
